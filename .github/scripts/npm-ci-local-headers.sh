# Node that runs it. node-pty ships no Linux prebuilds, so node-gyp compiles it;
# by default node-gyp first downloads the headers from nodejs.org, which makes the
# install depend on that download. Every Node release archive already carries
# them under include/node, so node-gyp is pointed there and given an empty
# download directory that must still be absent afterwards.
