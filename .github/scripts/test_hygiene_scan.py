"""Self-test for hygiene_scan — every rule catches its case, and only its case.

Three things are proved here, because a scanner can fail in three ways and only
one of them is visible from its output:

  1. each rule catches the shape it is for (VECTORS);
  2. each rule is the one doing the catching — disabling it makes its own vector
     pass, so a rule cannot be quietly redundant or dead (the mutation half);
  3. the two scanners in this repository do not overlap — no line is reported by
     both hygiene_scan and secret_scan, in either direction.

Plus the properties that are about the tree rather than the text: a clean tree
passes, a symlink that leaves the repository fails, and a file that cannot be
decoded is a FAILURE rather than a skip.

Run: python test_hygiene_scan.py   (exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail)
No test framework, no network, no fixtures on disk — the tree is built in a
temporary directory and removed again.
